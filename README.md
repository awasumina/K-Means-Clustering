# KMeans Clustering on Movie Data

This project demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering on a dataset that includes features like `director_facebook_likes` and `actor_3_facebook_likes`. The objective is to group the data into clusters based on these features and visualize the results.

## Project Overview

In this project, we perform the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing data by dropping NaN values.
   - Extract relevant features for clustering.

2. **KMeans Clustering**:
   - Initialize and fit the KMeans model with 5 clusters.
   - Analyze the cluster centers, labels, and the distribution of data points across clusters.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the clusters using a scatter plot to understand the grouping of data points.



## Output Summary:
The cluster centers represent the centroids of the 5 clusters in the feature space.The labels array indicates the cluster assignment for each data point.The unique labels and their counts give insight into the distribution of data points across clusters.


## Results

The clustering model groups the data into 5 clusters based on the selected features. The scatter plot provides a visual representation of how the data points are grouped.
